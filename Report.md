## 4. Results
| Model                   | RMSE  | R² Score | MAE  |
|-------------------------|-------|----------|------|
| Linear Regression       | 0.87  | 0.62     | 0.68 |
| Random Forest           | 0.72  | 0.74     | 0.56 |
| Gradient Boosting       | 0.68  | 0.77     | 0.52 |
| Neural Network          | 0.65  | 0.79     | 0.50 |

## 5. Key Findings
