# Movie Rating Prediction

Predicting movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors using machine learning.

## Project Description
This project analyzes historical movie data to build regression models that predict movie ratings. It covers:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Result interpretation

## Dataset
The dataset contains [X] movies with features including:
- Title
- Director
- Actors
- Genre
- Runtime
- Release Year
- Rating (target variable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks in order

## Results
Best model achieved RMSE of [X] and RÂ² score of [X] (see full report)
